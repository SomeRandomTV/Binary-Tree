# Binary-Tree
The Binary Tree is similar to the BST.
The only difference is that in BST values are sorted and in a BT they are just added.
There is no function to insert a node because it is easier to add them manually.
Ex: root->left->left->right = getNewNode(4)
That would add the node to the 3rd level on the right of the left most node.
